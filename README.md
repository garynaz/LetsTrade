## Inspiration
As a gamer, I would often take advantage of marketplace apps where I could buy, sell, or trade my video games 
with other hobbiests, and this is what inspired me to build this app. I wanted to build an app that was primarily 
targeting the retro gamer community. Video games have been around for over 30 years, and over time, it's becoming 
increasingly difficult to find retro and vintage video game products. Many enthusiasts would often resort to ebay,
kijiji, craigslist, and local conventions to find their desired retro product, however these markets are not exclusive 
to video game products, and that's where RetroTrader comes in. RetroTrader is designed for the gamers, buy the gamers 
to facilitate finding, buying, and trading rare and vintage video game products.
